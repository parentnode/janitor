janitor
=====

The janitor does the dirty work - enables site updates from anywhere.

Janitor is a content management framework. It is NOT a CMS. It has been designed to build custom content managements systems, not to be one on its own.
It provides a flexible item model and a set of utlitilies to handle most CMS-related tasks. You do the rest.

Currently in alpha state, while transitioning from old framework source.
